### Competition: 2021 IEEE SPGC-COVID Challenge

The **2021 IEEE Signal Processing Grand Challenge (SPGC)** aimed to develop automated frameworks to classify **volumetric chest CT scans** into three categories:
- COVID-19,
- CAP (Community Acquired Pneumonia), and
- Normal cases.

### Dataset: SPGC-COVID Dataset

This project utilizes the **SPGC-COVID Dataset** ([Dataset link](https://doi.org/10.34740/kaggle/dsv/2866458)), which includes:
- **51 COVID-19 cases**,
- **28 CAP cases**, and
- **51 normal cases**.

The dataset also contains CT scans of patients with heart conditions and includes images with varying technical parameters. All scans are available in **DICOM format**, with *patient-level labels* provided in CSV format.
